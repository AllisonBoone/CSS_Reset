# CSS_Reset
Css reset project

Is a css file that has stylings that would allow me and others to have a better "Default" or blank canvas when startinh a new webpage. It gets rid of browser default css so you have better control over how you would like to style you page. As well as some accessability and functionality styling that has no barring on the style of the page itself but more so featured you would probably have to go and add yourself eventually.
